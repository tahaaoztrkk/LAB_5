# task_1
Create a class named Rectangle with two data members: width and height. 
Add a member function named calculateArea() that returns the area of the rectangle. 
In the main() function, create an object of Rectangle, assign values to width and height, and 
display the calculated area. 
# task_2
Create a class named ArrayOperations that contains an integer array with 5 elements as a 
member variable. 
Add a method named calculateSum() that returns the total sum of all array elements. 
In the main() function, create an object, assign values to the array elements, and print the sum. 
# task_3
Create a class named Circle with one data member: radius. 
Add a method named calculateArea() that returns the area of the circle (use the formula π × r 
× r, and define π as 3.14). 
In the main() function, create a Circle object, set its radius, and display the area. 
# task_4
Create a class named Temperature with one data member: celsius. 
Add two methods: 
• toFahrenheit() → converts Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula F = (C × 9/5) + 32. 
• toKelvin() → converts Celsius to Kelvin using the formula K = C + 273.15. 
In the main() function, create an object, assign a Celsius value, and display both 
conversions.
